  "Description": "This mod adds fishing to Caves Of Qud! Now you can make or find a fishing rod and use it to capture delicious fish from various water pools!\nTo fish: first acquire a Fishing Rod and then interact with water. You will cast a line. If you are successful you will feel a tug on your line. Move away from the water to reel it in! (it might take a couple of attempts to reel in the fish, pass a turn to give up and let the fish go) If you have the Fishing skill you may cast a line and then pass turns to continue fishing.\n\nSitting on a chair increases your chance of catching things.\n\nThe skill \"Fishing\" is listed under \"Cooking And Gathering\". If you have the fishing skill then you can cast your line once and then wait by passing turns until you catch a fish. The fishing skill also drastically increases the variety of fish you can catch.\n\nFishing rods can be purchased from Argyve, created with Tinkering, or found throughout the world.\n\nSprites created by CuddlyClover: https://twitter.com/cuddlyclover\n\nYou can find the code and report issues on this plugin at: https://github.com/acegiak/qudfishing",
