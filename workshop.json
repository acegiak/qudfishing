Now you can make or find a fishing rod and use it to capture delicious fish from various water pools!\nTo fish: first acquire a Fishing Rod and then interact with water. You will cast a line. If you are successful you will reel in a fish! If you have the Fishing skill you may cast a line and then pass turns to continue fishing.\n\nSitting on a chair increases your chance of catching things.\n\nThe skill \"Fishing\" is listed under \"Cooking And Gathering\". If you have the fishing skill then you can cast your line once and then wait by passing turns until you catch a fish.
